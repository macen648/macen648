Version 1.0.2

A basic discord bot made with discord.js

My first ever discord bot using the discord.js framework.

So far it only has 3 basic commands.
Will update as I develop more commands.

Base bot prefix is "-"

## List of commands
    changePrefix - Changes bot's prefix.
    definition - Get the definition of a word(is limitted to the https://dictionaryapi.dev/ api being used).
    help - Get a full list of all commands/extra info.
    ping - Is used to get bot's responce time.
    liam - Tells liam hes fat.
    

## Issues
- need to update command parameters handler to allow the use of optional parameters in a 
less complicated way/allow more then one optional parameter.
- the output of the definition command isnt perfect, need to fix the output of multiple definitions of a word.
